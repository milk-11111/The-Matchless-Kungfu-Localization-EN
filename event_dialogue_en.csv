"5274c1139594cda715ed86fc00d2f9ab","It's Monkey's Wine."
"8e0439b9f891816da42596bd53fa0374","Hmm, strong booze mellowed with rich fruit. Robust, with a hint of sweetness. A true delicacy. So they were stealing from me to brew their own Monkey's Wine. It all makes sense now."
"951387e02efd1db8aa3344626659eb6f","Perhaps you could give them some wine once in a while?"
"9613f545896945e4b1b9e2e7710b182e","You have a point. Had I known what they were up to, I would have put some liquor in the backyard for them to take. Here, take this money. Thank you for figuring it out. I would have still been in the dark otherwise."

"ef3db1b78b18f29cd12926632e309a2c","I am the Heavenly Saint. For centuries I've walked the Kungfu world, and honed my skills to perfection. Yet I was felled when defending the beings of these Wilds, stripped to my primordial spirit, having to possess bodies to exist."
"4cc121ccb71c8b110f4076a308aaa632","Who are the Venerables?"
"5c75d6f6d803f4cc36379194b7b6303a","Heh, the so-called Venerables are the most wicked beings to walk this earth. Centuries ago, they founded the Huanmos Temple and used vile means to collect the world's Kungfu Skills, destroying numerous sects in the process. All they wanted was to control the Great Wilds and place the whole world under their tyranny."
"bf297ddf4f846e557ab560386cd3bb0d","Who am I?"
"39ead1b91ab80aa9812813e30be36825","As for you, haha. Hundreds of years ago, there was one who strode the Wilds undefeated. One hailed as a Kungfu legend, the unchallenged champion of the martial arts world. Indignant at the deeds of the Huanmos Temple, the righteous hero set out with his friend to take down Huanmos."
"e4dc119f45886b41b93b62c490ae506b","Would that be... !"
"e47e6c92d875765aff9468569e85b160","Yes. You are the Kungfu legend of yore, the uncrowned lord of the Wilds. And I...I am the Heavenly Saint, the friend who fought alongside you in Huanmos Temple."
"53744097592d37b882fda587551521e3","And what became of that battle?"
"80ea8c8e4c1a19a480d67ec23d75a4e2","We suffered a crushing defeat. Turns out there were a band of Primal Kungfu masters in Huanmos Temple, while on our side, we two were the only ones to reach that realm. Faced with such disparity, you were gravely wounded and fell into a coma, while my body was destroyed, leaving only my primordial spirit."
"30b9070a5195ed9ea569ccd69ead7008","What about the ship? What's the ship about?"
"e5209f4a03926dd4a247ce6460e05d63","That's the Ferry. The Venerables use it to reap the world. Inhabitants of the Wilds offer their valuables. Kungfu experts are ferried to Huanmos Temple, where they are devoured and assimilated, to ensure the Venerable's rule."
"85510b7a08e306ca087efb9870a588d4","Are they aware of their fate?"
"2bbabcfd78a2f428bf9bd174ce14871b","Would that make any difference? You saw what the Venerables are capable of. They have ascended the Primal realm, far beyond the reach of mortals. Their wield a truly terrible power. Whoever dares defy them will be erased from the world, the entire family exterminated."
"a0c81d8cbea217a43113558d32d3177f","Why do they call me Cultivator?"
"0de11805763c81bc0f4a9ecacf9c7738","Hahaha. You cultivate the world, just like a farmer. They brainwash those who defy Huanmos, until they become mere pawns. These pawns surveil the world for them, removing uncertainties and fortifying their rein."
"88bab03e70f2decc5c910468563e61fa","Why did I wake up on the ship?"
"ee413c5f14839aea25dc869d553dc155","After our defeat, I went into hiding, thinking I no longer had the power to defy Huanmos Temple. Little did I expect to see you again, here in the Wilds. Fortunately, you were born with Kungfu talent, and I needed very little effort to summon back your primordial spirit and soul. That's why you were able to learn all these Kungfu skills with ease. After all, you created many of them yourself."
"97b8f2e2664463c9be3887d0a1a78fac","It all makes sense now."
"e5dd9d803624d8636f324b7cb4dbe089","...What do you plan to do next?"
"62b2fae0a1d519ac15dcfcec1f2f5127","It's not about me. It's about both of us!  Should we uproot Huanmos Temple and restore this world to peace and order? Or spend our days in hiding, watching as people suffer."
"3f4dee52bde35c39eb05618cb55b45a3","For the sake of the innocent people, we cannot evade our obligation."
"de3806dfa71316057a7cc8ca4b4e48e2","Haha, exactly the hero I remember! Well said. In this world of ruin, who else can shoulder this obligation, if not us?"
"01fd84134a0b56d983a7ec1f34283705","Tell me what I need to do."
"d90475822f13657a9bac4551d9828065","You need to cross the ocean. Head north and seek the Huanmos Temple realms beyond the sea. They have sharks in the sea. You must be very careful. If you have good Energy, you can use the Qinggong Fly On Water and traverse the sea. If you have enough Vigor, you can try being swallowed by a shark, as it will bring you straight to Huanmos Temple."
"2afc51a4502a0bb23b964d516257a474","Are we going just like this? From what you told me, I'm not what I used to be."
"ab30540f01eff7042bdab4b0c010e426","Of course not, if the Venerables were vigilant. But so used to power they are, they have long ceased to care about worldly affairs.

"6df0cb02d978c75b9a171be757612fbb","Damn it, don't run!"
"603bad558d8e8eccaacf09918dc1db88","Strange, what is it? Why does he scream and kill me?"
"a4fb0a1cf670aae5947eeedde39617ef","You have a restrained murderous aura, and the blood evil spirit keeps reverberating around you. Are you the successor of the Extinction Sword Technique? You have allowed me to find you."
"88096a26a9b75d7db4eb417e624e1824","There may be some misunderstanding."
"1b5bc24dd50718bc582bf6ce70175aca","Misunderstanding. This annihilation sword technique killed seventy-two members of my family back then. Can everything be stopped with just one misunderstanding? It's too easy."
"f54d1a5726253d1b46653b8d7842e429","What happened back then has nothing to do with me."
"088481d2cf6acf026d9a80137599e252","It has nothing to do with you? Then where did the Absolute Sword come from? At that time, the Absolute Sword was supposed to be trapped in the deep valley with that person. Afterwards, I and other descendants went to search, but the body of the murderer was not found. Now you are carrying the Absolute Sword. How could it be that the sword reappears and has nothing to do with you?"
"ae049d7872fe56b3ef2c08e7b7c35e41","It's really an unexpected bonus."
"feaa2cff8361bd0c6ca60eb56d30983e","Your clothes are full of blood and you kill innocent people indiscriminately. Even if this sword technique of annihilation is really your unexpected acquisition and has nothing to do with the original incident, you are still another ruthless murderer. No need to say more, draw your sword."
"965e8f3ac35200e09f9b9aa49fab323e","Hey, why don't you believe me? (draws sword)"

"23cb593c052a9ea89215454733e3e8f8","Oh, you are hypocritical. Are all those who have mastered swordsmanship as hypocritical as you?"
"373e18361d550b59b8dc3ad4f5eb4e31","I don't kill people, but if people kill me, it's useless!"

"f515070f84c30c477bdac314fbe9494b","I originally wanted to convince myself not to be reasonable with people who possess the Extermination Sword Technique. But seeing how little murderous aura you have around you, even if you learn the Extermination Sword Technique, you are obviously not a treacherous and evil person who kills innocent people indiscriminately.

Everyone is like this, causing hatred to be like a net, woven around the world. I have become an insect in this net, and I can't help it. There is no place to escape. Before I saw you today, I felt that I was well prepared, but when the time came, I couldn't deceive myself into taking action against you."
"2cc88aaaba2bed792b621f22c661d1c2","What kind of blood debt did that person leave behind that he has not forgotten to this day?"
"a2f8441a26b72a0fd8c81b752068dd85","I also heard from my fathers that that man became obsessed with evil. He slaughtered several sects and families with one person and one sword, so that everyone in the world was in danger. If the seniors hadn't taken action in time, he would have been defeated and trapped in a deep valley. I'm afraid I won't be able to see each other today without you."

"8be6c23a06553b4855ec65db5d2a32b7","Exactly, that senior is a child of a noble family. He has pure internal energy. Even the successor of the Absolute Sword could not hurt him at all, and eventually trapped him to death in a deep valley."
"566f3da6599fe801720a84d89b5f1175","That's all. I see that you are not a person who kills indiscriminately. Since you have nothing to do with that person at the beginning, and there is an owner for every injustice, I should not pay it back to you anyway. Farewell."

"6e5c6aa16661684b06586e9ccd1f3edb","Something is wrong. According to a senior, the bloodthirsty successor of the Absolute Sword was forced into the abyss by a couple who were lovers of swordsmanship. He was not a senior from aristocratic family."
"c90399c47b8f3bbc6e7c693e0b7f0668","That's strange. My elders shouldn't have lied to me. Where did the senior who told you this come from and where does he live now?"
"95f8fb51483421e8a5605f3e066b270c","According to what he said, he was the one who witnessed the murder. As for where he is now, I don't know."
"09a17fab5340782873dd5cc5cac753b9","It seems that this can only be the case. Even the elders don't know the full story of what happened back then. If someone who experienced it at that time speaks for themselves, perhaps everything can be clarified."
"46e79890487e1488820b90722e861ce8","In this case, I will tell you after I find my senior and find out everything."
"f4458010bc80287b982e5b091e61afbc","I came here to seek revenge, but I didn't expect to make a friend like you. That's all. I hope you will pay more attention to this matter. See you later."

"e94dc1a0fe9b5a9b9989897c32f80862","Misunderstanding, what's the misunderstanding? I have heard from my fathers since I was a child that the descendants of the Extermination Sword Technique were devoid of humanity and became murderous. They once killed seventy-two members of my family. Even though I am defeated by the sword, I don't need your pretentious pity."

"490f12aae9531a5e932de7bd0dbae4c1","You have very little murderous aura around you. I yelled at you to beat and kill, but you were willing to explain to me after defeating me. Obviously, even if you learned the Extermination Sword Technique, you are not a treacherous and evil person who kills innocent people indiscriminately."

"b42ac7da9b234e600cfec1eb3aabf126","Although you have a solid foundation, your strength is still far from the top. If the Descendants of Extinction were really at your level, they wouldn't have been able to commit such murders back then."

"db4b9ecd5a09b3f2d217c9db8d819a02","Thank you. I needed that cash for my ailing wife. The doctor asked a towering fee. Without you, I really don't know what I could have done. Here's what you lent me. Please count it."

"cd3d6eb3a48a664bfa7d0054c5595509","You sense the person's clearly injured. His story differs from what you heard at Bamboo Pond. Something seems amiss."

"2274c371d5ebcff3fffccb7f448ed476","Heh. What's the show for?"

"7c5caaa65f183775931231f1437524f0","I'll tell you then. I saw a shadow slip past my bed, so I gave chase, and ended up outside the Master's hall. A concealed weapon barely missed me, just before the Master stepped out the door. We bumped right into each other."
"2b4656535783e2925b7612dafab19d5c","If what you said is true, the culprit deliberately lured you out to frame you."
"3ba24e7ecdc5a2f8ec9b05d0b4fce793","You're saying they're only seeking me to investigate this?"
"09db5fd5971378dd72648aaf2623c9ac","Haha! Why else would I seek you out? His palm struck hard, and he thought he succeeded. So he spoke your name. But he didn't expect me to escape and find you."
"00fcc8782fb317969cc6be292a231be8","I don't know who attacked you, but why not kill you with weapons?"
"e6a47f0ceb271104f5fc029971f74b5a","What's more, if he truly wanted to clean house, there was no need to name me at all."
"c05470f36fb1cd973ef38cc00b5f6600","You see his expression change, clearly persuaded by your words."
"28650e6185b05271b5f6bb76a6266c44","Letting you go intentionally to pit us against each other...What a wicked plot!"
"1596f61628bfa5d8b4ac390b320eef82","How did you get away?"
"458e7bff33dbc88dec6db7be1733c56a","When I went out today, a fellow disciple sought me out and said the Master summoned me to the Hall. But halfway there, he suddenly struck me from behind with his palm. I used that force to fly back and barely escaped."
"13ad75ae761bfb8b317dfb6fb81b5121","Looks like he's your equal in skill. After injuring you, he could only let you flee."
"fef1650ea51edd08e5c3afb790f03e8f","But if you're evenly matched, why not give chase when you fled?"
"82f9553e9ba0ae38bab6ff279c76dbec","Well..."
"e3ac1b70a14d14863b2a3ca67d1cb165","You were injured. Even if you have supreme Qinggong, he should have relentlessly chased you down. Why would he let you go?"
"8a19b05e22244a86dd3633db8a899fcc","Looks like we were both played for fools."
"d0a490fe9d3408580fa8b3aa508cbbc3","Do you mean...? !"
"492f58b1d5675590737590331314a2d1","Indeed, there's something amiss about the affair at Bamboo Pond. I, the borrowed knife. You, the scapegoat."
"c2e7e872e36b53b5d67d4f547cfb7f34","If that's the case, this is a conspiracy that targets not just the Master, but also the entire Bamboo Pond! Framing me as a traitor and expelling me will put the sect at ease, lowering their guard!"
"24277860cab13190ddb105d19ab1a78f","Exactly. Looks like you're not stupid after all."
"85c2e3114f0931ea3120dcf8b712603e","What should we do now?"
"547dc56901e21e98419b9d8539caa125","The first option is to return to Bamboo Pond, find the clues, and confront the mastermind. Stand tall! The second option is to let it pass. The conspirators clearly are scheming against the Bamboo Pond. If we run far enough, never to set step into Bamboo Pond again, we'll probably leave unscathed. Lie low!"
"94ddb02adb7189bb973dae0dcd923f0e","There two options before us."
"e8e824f2b313a6986b6a1e5d0eebc3c2","We're in the same boat. If it hadn't been for you, I would have still been fooled. I trust your judgment."
"688d446e95ca0859fba7f305bc5804bc","... (What should I do? )"
"bd8c703e728485932ea2a6c9c9e3ea89","The first choice. I'm no man's pawn. This isn't over yet."
"11b42aa5e5c8ee1d4c789bc67975dcf0","What should we do? I'll follow your lead."
"1859316f54419d069eee4a39392e9560","If I return, the conspirator will only react in two ways. One - he thinks you're dead. By eliminating me, he can tie up all loose ends."
"b06a8202735c015a809e15cb94d64482","I'll go back alone."
"ccbd404ab99a28880dacc1f1a43ee2c0","Two - they think you're still alive. You haven't sought me out yet, or haven't confronted me for other reasons. In this case, he'll be more cautious, as he doesn't know what's up with you."
