"plot_content_1","Cut it out! Don't yell! I'm the only one who can hear you here. It's been a century, and you've arrived, at long last..."
"plot_content_2","Who are you? How come I can’t see you? Are you a human,or a ghost?"
"plot_content_3","Humph! Of course I'm human! Ah well, I'll let it pass. \\nI am the <TDName>「Heavenly Saint」</>. Just call me <TDName>「St. Heavens」</>. \\nAs for why you can hear me...I'm a Guru in <TDName>「Whispered Secret」</>. Such a feat is but a breeze to me."
"plot_content_4","<TDName>「St.」</>……<TDName>「Heavens」</>? What is this place? Where are you hiding? ?"
"plot_content_5","I've strode these lands for centuries, and amassed no shortage of foes. Should word of our meeting spread too soon, I fear I might be forced to endure another hundred years. \\nKnow simply that this land is called <TDName>「Great Wilds」</>. The very place where you and I are trapped. You must hasten to master strength and ascend to <TDName>「Champion」</>. When that time comes, I shall reveal to you how to free me from my confinement."
"plot_content_6","Of course, I shall not let you go unprepared. All martial arts in the <TDName>「Great Wilds」</> stem from my teachings. You bear my sigil; as long as you acquire a kungfu technique, mastery will come with ease. \\nTake this <TDName>「Heavenly Scrolls」</>. Should you face challenges, I shall provide answers. May you rise swiftly to greatness. This serves both our interests."
"plot_content_7","The <TDName>「Heavenly Scrolls」</> contains the essence of my knowledge. Its wisdom will be unveiled with your Trials."
"plot_content_8","I suppose I have no other choice. But why is this <TDName>「Great Wilds」</> so tiny?"
"plot_content_9","Tiny? \\n……\\nAlas, it appears too much time has passed. You have forgotten your own nature. Lad, remember this: You are a <TDName>「Cultivator」</>. Once you regain your strength, you will come to understand the many secrets of this world."
"plot_content_10","So what should I do now?"
"plot_content_11","...\\nIndeed, you have forgotten a great deal. Here, let me lend you a hand, as I still have some time. \\nThere is a <TDName>「Regional Trial」</> in every lot in the <TDName>「Great Wilds」</>. You can pass the Trial in this lot first."
"plot_content_101","Excellent! Your skills and intellect well exceed my expectations. \\nKeep up the good work. There is hope for my liberation! Hahahaha."
"plot_content_102","What should I do next?"
"plot_content_103","Open <TDName>「Pigeon Post」</>, and you'll see how to cultivate the <TDName>「Great Wilds」</>. There are unique resources in each region. \\nUse them to help you grow. Know that the world is a complicated place. Tread with care. \\nIf you have deep pockets, try seeking out <TDName>「Cargo Ships」</> to expand new lots."
"plot_content_104","Uh...I got it."
"plot_content_201","Hold on! Don't go further into the sea! It's dangerous!"
"plot_content_202","What’s out there in the sea? !!"
"plot_content_203","Why? Looks calm enough to me."
"plot_content_204","Go back, now's not the time! When the time comes, I shall tell you everything."
"plot_content_205","I need to see for myself what is out there."
"plot_content_206","Ah well. A taste of hardship will do the lad some good."
"plot_content_301","As the world expands, more forces will emerge in the <TDName>「Great Wilds」</>. You won't be able to navigate its treacherous waters without considerable strength. Right now, it's important that you join a sect and build up your skills. From there, you can make your way to your <TDName>「Champion」</> mantle."
"plot_content_302","How can I join a sect?"
"plot_content_303","There's a <TDName>「Bulletin Board」</> at the Mountain Gate of every sect. You can take a look, see if you meet their Entry Requirements."
"plot_content_304","Got it."
"plot_content_401","Take heed! <TDName>「Bandits」</> will appear in new lots. Eliminate these thugs, and you can build a Reputation. Remember to demolish their Shacks and Cages, lest other ruffians take shelter again."
"plot_content_402","What if I’m no match for them?"
"plot_content_403","Hire bodyguards, or set up traps. Sometimes it's prudent to avoid confrontation. Once you've become stronger and commanded your own forces, these bandits will be nothing more than small-time crooks."
"plot_content_404","Got it."
"plot_content_1000","What else do you want to know about?"
"plot_content_1001","How can I join a sect?"
"plot_content_1002","There's a Bulletin Board at the Mountain Gate of every sect. You can take a look, see if you meet their Entry Requirements. But I'm not sure whether you're worthy or not."
"plot_content_1003","Do you know where to find treasure?"
"plot_content_1004","Horses like eating grass. Monkeys like pinecones or plums. Martens and snakes like meat and eggs. Eagles like meat."
"plot_content_1005","When will the Kungfu Contest begin?"
"plot_content_1006","Soon there will be a Kungfu Contest in areas with such a campaign. I can't wait any longer. Is there anything that a martial arts champion can't do? Hahahaha!"
"plot_content_1007","How to cure Ailment?"
"plot_content_1008","You can use your Chi to heal minor injury. If the injury is too severe, you can go to clinic for healing. But Clinics often charge a high fee. . ."
"plot_content_1009","How to make money?"
"plot_content_1010","Trade, complete commissions, or work at all kinds of stores. But doing illegal business always earns more. Ahaha, just like taking supplements will make you stronger!"
"plot_content_1011","How to become invincible?"
"plot_content_1012","Hehe, no one is invincible in this world. You can improve your power by collecting more Skills, Inner Kungfu, Abilities, and Gears. But remember, only the fitting combination means the true power."
"plot_content_1013","How to acquire Qinggong Guru?"
"plot_content_1014","I heard that you can acquire advanced Qinggong at the Eagle Hunt Platform and Mirror Lake Stonewoods."
"plot_content_1015","Your Likes?"
"plot_content_1016","Your Relations?"
"plot_content_1017","Your Bio?"

"plot_content_1023","How to learn Sect Kungfu?"
"plot_content_1024","You can buy the sect's Skill and Inner Kungfu manuals at the Bookcase in the Training Room. Once you've earned enough Prestige in the sect, these manuals are all yours to take."
"plot_content_1025","How to get a promotion?"
"plot_content_1026","You can gain Prestige by challenging members of higher rank or completing commissions from sect members. Once your Prestige reaches the requisite for the next level, you can ask the Master for a promotion."
"plot_content_1027","How to increase Prestige?"
"plot_content_1028","Complete more sect orders, or donate resources to the Warehouse."
"plot_content_1029","What do you usually do in the Training Room?"
"plot_content_1030","My daily duties involve checking the equipment in the Training Room, such as the 「Dummies」 and 「Bookcases」. If I notice any issues, I work quickly to make repairs or replacements so everything is in top condition for the disciples."
"plot_content_1031","What do you usually do in the Warehouse?"
"plot_content_1032","I've managed the Warehouse for some time. My day-to-day involves logging all resource usage so that funds and materials are properly kept for our disciples."
"plot_content_1033","What do you usually do in the Jail?"
"plot_content_1034","Well, I may not be a martial arts master, but I've got plenty of experience when it comes to guarding and interrogating prisoners. The good Master has a lot of trust in my work, and has assigned me to handle all the important prisoners. I manage the 「Jail」, where we detain all the rule breakers and troublemakers."
"plot_content_1035","What do you usually do at the Tavern?"
"plot_content_1036","I make sure that everything runs smoothly, the 「Wine Shelves」 are well-stocked, and the 「Wine Tables」 are making good income. It's fun listening to the drunken ramblings of heroes. It's my dream to run a cozy tavern for my guests."
"plot_content_1037","What do you usually do at the Stable?"
"plot_content_1038","I make a living by selling horses and running a station at the 「Stable」. I also have a collection of curios in the Counter, and I sell various goods at the Grocery Cabinet. Unless there's something big going on, you'll usually find me here."
"plot_content_1039","What do the animals like to eat?"
"plot_content_1040","From what I know, 「Horses」 like eating wild grass. 「Eagles」 like eating meat. 「Monkeys」 like eating pinecones and plums. 「Snakes」 and 「Martens」 like eating meat and eggs, and 「Chickens」 love all sorts of worms."
"plot_content_1041","What do you usually do at the Smithy?"
"plot_content_1042","I make a living by selling forged Weapons and Concealed Weapons at the 「Weapon Shelf」. Whenever I have enough materials, I craft weapons. I have dedicated my life to the forge, and created many weapons renowned in the martial world."
"plot_content_1043","What do you usually do at the Fabric Shop?"
"plot_content_1044","I make a living by selling hats, tops, and pants at the 「Hanger」. Whenever I have enough materials, I weave better outfits. My greatest joy is creating peerless gear for heroes, so that they can command awe as they travel the world."
"plot_content_1045","What do you usually do at the Spring?"
"plot_content_1046","I make a living by running the 「Spring」. My motivation is simple: I hope more people can enjoy the wonders of hot springs and find blissful respite here."
"plot_content_1047","What do you usually do at Langya Pavilion?"
"plot_content_1048","I make a living by selling contraptions at the 「Mechanism Shelf」. People come to me for home decorations, hunter's traps, and camouflage tools. That's life for me."
"plot_content_1049","What do you usually do at the Clinic?"
"plot_content_1050","I make a living by treating patients on 「Sickbeds」 and selling potions at the 「Potion Shelf」. In my spare time, I concoct potions and cultivate my inner self. I ask neither the name nor origin of my patients. As long as I can heal them, I'll do my best. That's my philosophy."
"plot_content_10491","I need a cure"
"plot_content_10501","Come lie down. Let me take a look."
"plot_content_1051","What do you usually do at the Music House?"
"plot_content_1052","Why do I run a Music House? It's simple. I hope more people can appreciate the charm of music. Take a sip, enjoy a melody. What's more delightful than that?"
"plot_content_1053","What do you usually do at the Village?"
"plot_content_1054","I come from a long line of framers, so I'm good at planting all sorts of crops. Everyday I tend to my crops in the 「Fields」. People also come to me for herbs."
"plot_content_1055","How can I join a sect?"
"plot_content_1056","There's a Bulletin Board at the Mountain Gate of every sect. You can take a look, see if you meet their Entry Requirements. Some sects also send invitations through Pigeon Post."
